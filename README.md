# OurC-Interpreter
OurC is a simplified but slightly extended C language. It has five primitive data types (int, float, char, bool, and string), one-dimensional array, and no struct or enum.  There are function calls, compound statements, conditional constructs (if-then-else) and loop constructs (while-loop and do-while loop).
